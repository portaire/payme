# Portaire tech test 

## What is this ?
This is a tech test for Portaire. It is a simple web app that allows you to pay for 
an nondescript item. 

## Explanation 

Hey, I've added a couple of tools from my boilerplate that I use to help me along the first thing being plop. Plop is a tool that allows you to generate files from templates. I've added a couple of templates you can use plop with `yarn generate` saves a lot of time over the long run üëÄ.¬† 

I've also built all of these components in storybook with variations, this is to help you understand the components and how they work (makes it easier explain components and usage async). The approach of developing in storybook first should add little to none time to your development process.
