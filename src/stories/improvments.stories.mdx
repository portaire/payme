## Improvments

An example of some things I would have done without spending 20 hours on the tech test.

1. added some testing at least for the validation logic on the forms
2. fully test the accessiblity i've left a hint of what im capable of in terms of accessibility but i would have liked to have done more.
3. i've done my best with the fonts I could find, if they're not 100% correct I would switch them out (might see slight variation).
4. I would have like to make this responsive, however the design seems to only cater for desktop hence the desktop only.
5. I would have liked to spend a lot more time on the types etc and show an example of how TS is used, however due to time constraints I've left this out.
