# UpdatePaymentMethod

<br />
<br />

## Approach

To keep it simple I require the previous data to be available all the time to save some null checks, otherwise I would have added more null checks to account for this.

I added some extra error states and validation, but I would have to check with the designer if this is what they want.

I have also left all accessiblity outlines in.

the fancy algo is in.

## Examples

<br />

<Story name="default">
  <UpdatePaymentMethod
    prevData={{
      address_one: "221b Baker St",
      address_two: "London",
      email: "john@doe.com",
      first_name: "Sherlock",
      last_name: "Holmes",
      post_code: "NW1 6XE",
      state: "London",
    }}
  />
</Story>
