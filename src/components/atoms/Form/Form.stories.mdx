# Form

Just a helper atom to handle the submit, for the tech test I didn't need to make this more reusable hence the post.

it accepts a single prop handleSubmit from react hook form.

## Example usage

```jsx
<Form handleSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input type="text" />
  <input type="submit" />
</Form>
```
