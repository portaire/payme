# Button

<br />
<br />

## Approach

I created the design with a min-width as through the example application the px are not rounded suggesting they are % based however,
I have added a minimum width to ensure its not to small.

<br />
<br />

## Examples

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="default">
    <Button>Example button text</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Variants

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story
    name="variants"
    decorators={[
      (Story) => (
        <div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "20px" }}>
          <Story />
        </div>
      ),
    ]}
  >
    <Button>Update</Button>
    <Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
