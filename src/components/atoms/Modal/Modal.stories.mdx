# Modal

<br />
<br />

## Approach

The Modal component is a reusable composable component, which can be used to create a modal dialog. It is composed of two parts: the Modal and the Modal.Content. The Modal.Content is the content of the modal, which is hidden by default. The Modal is the trigger for the modal, which can be any element. When the Modal is clicked, the Modal.Content is shown.

## Examples

<br />
<br />

<Story name="default">
  <Modal label={"Open modal"}>
    <Modal.Content>
      <p>Modal Content</p>
    </Modal.Content>
  </Modal>
</Story>
