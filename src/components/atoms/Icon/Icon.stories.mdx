# Icon

Simple icon component build to be expandable, it can be used with any icon library.
An alternative and much better approach would be to have a SVG loader load each of the components,
however for the sake of simplicity and time, this is the approach I took.

## Examples

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story
    name="default"
    decorators={[
      (Story) => (
        <div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "20px" }}>
          <Story />
        </div>
      ),
    ]}
  >
    <Icon type="card" />
    <Icon type="stripe" />
    <Icon type="mag" />
    <Icon type="chevron-down" />
    <Icon type="pound" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
